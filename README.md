Text Summarization


Text Summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source file.

Text Summarization is a technique used to shorten a long piece of data/content with main content or essence marked with bullet points.


Types of text summarization :


(here we will learn about extractive and abstractive text summarization.)

Extractive Summarization — This approach selects passages from the source text and then arranges it to form a summary. One way of thinking about this is like a highlighter underlining the important sections. The main idea is that the summarized text is a sub portion of the source text.

Abstractive Summarization -In contrast, abstractive approach involves understanding the intent and writes the summary in your own words. I think of this as analogous to a pen.
The basic idea for creating a summary of any document includes the following:

Text Preprocessing (remove stopwords,punctuation).

Frequency table of words/Word Frequency Distribution — how many times each word appears in the document

Score each sentence depending on the words it contains and the frequency table

Build summary by joining every sentence above a certain score limit.
